#datetime-localizer.js

What Localizer does is to convert a date/time string into the end user's timezone.

For example, our server outputs the following HTML and datetime string:

````html
<span class="datetimelocalizer">16 Apr 2014, 12:00:00 GMT</span>
````

and the end user is in +0800 timezone:
 
> 16 Apr 2014, 8:00 pm

Simple!
